# Spree Mobility

This is a Spree model translation gem based on `spree_globalize` for [Spree Commerce][1] version 4.3+.
It uses `mobility` instead of `globalize`, since `globalize` is not actively developed anymore.
It is a drop-in replacement for `spree_globalize` and will use your existing translations.

Currently, this gem is tested with Spree 4.3.1. Since version 1.3, it should also work with Spree 4.4.

## Upgrading

Re-run `rails g spree_mobility:install` to add new migrations.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'spree_i18n', '~> 5.0'
gem 'friendly_id-mobility', git: 'https://github.com/mrbrdo/friendly_id-mobility', branch: 'master'
gem 'mobility', git: 'https://github.com/mrbrdo/mobility', branch: 'mrbrdo'
gem 'spree_mobility'
```

Run `bundle install`

You can use the generator to install migrations and append spree_mobility assets to
your app spree manifest file.

    rails g spree_mobility:install

It is also recommended to configure Mobility fallback locales, especially if your admin locale is not the same as your Store's default_locale. For example if you have en and de locale:

```ruby
# config/initializers/mobility.rb
Mobility.configure do
  plugins do
    fallbacks({ :en => [:de], :de => [:en] })
  end
end
```

## Spree 4.3.x

There is a bug with `Spree.ready` in Spree 4.3.x, as it hooks into Turbolinks,
but Turbolinks is not used in the backend. Due to this some translation links in
the admin won't work out of the box.
To fix this, add to the bottom of `vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/backend/all.js`:

```ruby
# vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/backend/all.js
$(window).on('load', function() { $(document).trigger('page:load'); });
```

## Improvements over spree_globalize

This gem offers several improvements over `spree_globalize`:

* Proper translation fallbacks support (if a translation for the current locale is missing, it will fallback to other locales, strictly based on configured fallbacks):
  * for finders (slug/permalink)
  * when searching by product name (frontend & admin search)
* Proper validations on translation models (e.g. slug presence validation), also meaning uniqueness validations will now work correctly per-locale
* Better support for future versions of Rails as `mobility` is more actively maintained

Admin:

* Rich-text editor for product description translations in admin (if enabled)
* Admin product search will no longer return duplicate results
* Works correctly if using custom Spree.admin_path config

For more localization features, see my `better_spree_localization` gem.

## Model Translations

This feature uses the [Mobility][3] gem to localize model data.
So far the following models are translatable:

    Product, Promotion, OptionType, Taxonomy, Taxon, Property, Store, ShippingMethod and PaymentMethod.

Start your server and you should see a TRANSLATIONS link or a flag icon on each
admin section that supports this feature.

*Every record needs to have a translation. If by any chance you remove `spree_mobility`
from your Gemfile, add some records and then add `spree_mobility` gem back you might get
errors like ``undefined method for nilClass`` because Mobility will try fetch
translations that do not exist.*
